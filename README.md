# My Pandas Exercises

This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises inspired by the [pandas_exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) repository created by [@guipsamora](https://github.com/guipsamora).

That original repo was created to provide hands-on practice for pandas — perfect for learners who are tired of just reading tutorials and want to *learn by doing*. Following that philosophy, I've started working through the exercises myself and uploading my own solutions here.

## 📚 What This Repo Includes

Each folder or notebook in this repo contains:
- Exercise instructions (copied or summarized)
- My manually written solutions with code and comments
- Occasional notes or explanations of my thought process

I’ve chosen this method to reinforce my understanding of pandas and build real data analysis skills.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

I recommend the following workflow (just like the original author suggests):

1. Learn a concept from a tutorial or video.
2. Try solving the related exercises yourself.
3. If stuck, first check the **solution description only** (not the code).
4. Only then look at my final code solution.
5. Optionally, watch the video solution to reinforce your learning.

## 🐍 Requirements

To run the exercises:

- Python 3.7+
